# segment-thing

the thing from https://youtu.be/rKHq4pD4hC0

i used an old game engine i had lying around

thanks to Boris Vasilev for making a sensible light game engine and letting me modify and use it

## This is now an actual thing.

# How To Use This Thing
<s>don't</s>

you need something that can send a GET request, I recommend `curl`

you need `feh` (or anything else that can change your wallpaper)

you need `Node.js` and `npm`

you need `git` for the installation (or you can download it manually)

you need an open port (because this application is a piece of s**t)

Step 1: `git clone https://codeberg.org/bankenstein/segment-thing`

Step 2: `cd segment-thing`

Step 3: `npm install`

Step 4: `node server.js`

Step 4: `curl http://localhost:6969/clock --output clock.png` (replace 6969 if you modified the port)

Step 5: set `clock.png` (or whatever you decided to call the file) as your wallpaper using your favourite wallpaper setter

I might make another shell script for starting the thing, if I can be arsed to do so.
