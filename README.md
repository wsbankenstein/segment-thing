i used an old game engine i had lying around

thanks to Boris Vasilev for making a sensible light game engine and letting me modify and use it

## This is now an actual thing.

# How To Use This Thing
<s>don't</s>

you need something that can send a GET request, I recommend `curl`

you need `feh` (or anything else that can change your wallpaper)

you need `Node.js` and `npm`

you need `git` for the installation (or you can download it manually)

you need an open port (because this application is a piece of s**t)

Step 1: `git clone https://codeberg.org/bankenstein/segment-thing`

Step 2: `cd segment-thing`

Step 3: `npm install`

Step 4: Edit `wallpaper.sh` to use your favourite wallpaper setter and port and tune the speed to your liking

Step 5: `./wallpaper.sh`

You could also consider running `wallpaper.sh` at startup.
